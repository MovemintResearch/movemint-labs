    <h2>Peptide Blends</h2>
    <div class="card-grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Glow Blend 70&nbsp;mg</h3>
        <p><strong>Contents per vial:</strong> GHK-Cu 50&nbsp;mg, BPC-157 10&nbsp;mg, TB-500 10&nbsp;mg.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Research focus:</strong> models of tissue repair, collagen
          modulation, angiogenesis, and recovery pathways. GHK-Cu is widely
          studied in skin and hair research, while BPC-157 and TB-500 commonly
          appear in pre-clinical models involving tendon, ligament, and muscle.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>KLOW Blend 80&nbsp;mg</h3>
        <p>
          Custom peptide combination formulated for exploratory work in wound
          healing, inflammation modulation, and recovery-oriented models where
          a standardized vialized blend is preferred over mixing single
          peptides each time.

        <h3>Tesamorelin 10&nbsp;mg</h3>
        <p>
          Synthetic analogue of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH). Used in
          research examining GH pulse dynamics, IGF-1 signalling, lipolysis, and
          body-composition endpoints in pre-clinical models.

        <h3>Ipamorelin 10&nbsp;mg</h3>
        <p>
          Selective growth hormone-releasing peptide (GHRP) investigated for its
          ability to stimulate GH release with relatively modest interaction
          with prolactin and cortisol in animal and in-vitro work.
        </p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Semax 10&nbsp;mg</h3>
        <p>
          Heptapeptide analogue researched for potential neuro-modulatory and
          neuro-protective effects in models involving stress response, learning
          behaviour, and cognitive endpoints.

        <p>
          Oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, an essential redox
          cofactor. Widely used in cell-based assays exploring mitochondrial
          function, sirtuin activity, and cellular energy metabolism.
