        <p><strong>Contents per vial:</strong> GHK-Cu 50&nbsp;mg, BPC-157 10&nbsp;mg, TB-500 10&nbsp;mg.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Research focus:</strong> models involving tissue repair,
          collagen modulation, angiogenesis, and recovery. GHK-Cu is widely
          used in skin and hair research; BPC-157 and TB-500 commonly appear in
          pre-clinical work on tendon, ligament, and skeletal-muscle recovery.

        <h3>KLOW Blend 80&nbsp;mg</h3>
        <p>
          Custom peptide combination formulated for exploratory work in wound
          healing, inflammation modulation, and recovery-oriented models. A
          standardized vialized blend can be useful where repeated mixing of
          individual peptides would add variability between experiments.

        <p>
          Selective growth hormone-releasing peptide (GHRP) investigated for its
          ability to stimulate GH release with relatively modest effects on
          prolactin and cortisol in animal and in-vitro work.

        <p>
          Pentadecapeptide originally derived from a gastric protein fragment.
          Appears in many pre-clinical studies exploring tendon and ligament
          repair, gut integrity, angiogenesis, and inflammatory modulation in
          animal models.

        <p>
          Mitochondria-derived peptide investigated in pre-clinical models of
          metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and cellular response to energetic
          stress. Often used to explore mitochondrial signalling and glucose
          handling pathways.
