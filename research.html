    <h2>Peptide Blends</h2>
    <div class="card-grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Glow Blend 70&nbsp;mg</h3>
        <p><strong>Contents per vial:</strong> GHK-Cu 50&nbsp;mg, BPC-157 10&nbsp;mg, TB-500 10&nbsp;mg.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Research focus:</strong> models of tissue repair, collagen
          regulation, angiogenesis, and recovery pathways. GHK-Cu is widely
          studied for skin and hair research; BPC-157 and TB-500 appear in
          animal models involving tendon, ligament, and muscle repair.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>KLOW Blend 80&nbsp;mg</h3>
        <p>
          Custom peptide combination designed for exploratory work in wound
          healing, inflammation modulation, and recovery models.
        </p>
        <p>
          Intended for lab teams needing a standardized vialized blend rather
          than mixing individual peptides for each experiment.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Tesamorelin 10&nbsp;mg</h3>
        <p>
          Synthetic GHRH (growth hormone–releasing hormone) analogue used in
          research on growth hormone pulses, lipolysis, and body composition
          models. Frequently used to study GH/IGF-1 axis modulation.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Ipamorelin 10&nbsp;mg</h3>
        <p>
          Selective growth hormone–releasing peptide (GHRP) studied for its
          ability to stimulate GH release with relatively low impact on
          prolactin and cortisol in animal and in-vitro work.
        </p>
        <p class="badge">Selective GHRP</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Semax 10&nbsp;mg</h3>
        <p>
          Heptapeptide analogue researched for potential neuro-protective and
          neuro-modulatory properties in models involving stress response and
          cognitive endpoints.

        <h3>NAD⁺ 1000&nbsp;mg</h3>
        <p>
          Oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, essential cofactor
          in redox reactions. Widely used in in-vitro work on mitochondrial
          function, sirtuin activation, and cellular energy metabolism.
